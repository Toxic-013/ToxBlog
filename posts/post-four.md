Well today was interesting
I feel like it would be very hard to find a new community, online-wise
but ima keep trying, since returning to manyland would be throwing away self control ig
And even if i did, i'd probably just keep to building shit.

Also guyssss, I just clicked like, that i've accidentally forshadowed the events of my books so many times. 
((so like, tox staring up at the skyscraper in one of the chapters is foreshadowing the chapter where he trys to jump off, and i didn't notice!!))

Also, I doubt anyone would even read these blogposts except for people i force to so.
i guess i can say whatever the fuck i want,
HOLLY YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID!!!!!!! ((thats a joke, holly, dont set your army on me))

Welp, cya's in the next dumb post~
bye gays
