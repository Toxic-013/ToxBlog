Hey readers!!!

Its been fucking ages since I've posted anything, holy shit.

I've been really busy putting together my reddit and discord servers, and also **totally not dying inside, at all!!!!!**

As british summer break approaches, I can only hope my fucking brain doesen't melt during this horrible heat wave.

Speaking of hot things:

**I** Chucked water all over some ugly big nose witch in my class!!!

Her name is leah peel, and she leaked one of my friends nudes because she's a witch who's ashamed of how **FLAT SHE IS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

Lol, She ran away screaming after I threw it on her, the fucking dramatic hoe.

Anyway, I'm really Happy that I have the energy to continue this blog, since it's like an online diary for me, I guess.

((Plus sharing my thoughts to strangers is *Somehow comforting to me?????*))

welp, Cya on the next post!!!
