I think i'm losing my interest in romance, just because the one guy I like is a complete doofus when it comes to love.
He just doesen't understand *How* to love, I guess.

Honestly, I dont think I'd really like anyone after him.
I'm not going to name him, for his own privacy, but holy shit do I want to.

Also, I had an okayish day, No real homophobic assholes asking sexual questions of me.
But The start of the day had me feeling a bit self-hatey, Eh.
Maybe i'm just manic again, But I have a good feeling about this week.

*just hope i dont crash again.*
