The universe is annoying me

The ammount of liars and scum is so so very sad.
The ammount of homophobia and bullying and so so much more.
The ammount of betrayal.

It just makes you wanna cry, doesen't it?

Though I guess it isn't **all** bad.
I think someone likes me.

Onto more, Useful news:

*I'm gonna start posting Other kinds of stuff on this site, other than blogs, So look out for the new blue button labled MISC POSTS that'll come soon!!*


Bye readers!
