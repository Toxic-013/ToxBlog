Wow, It's been forever since I've used this, huh?

Well, maybe I should discuss how much everything has changed!;
I'm now very much a music fan, and listen to underrated crap like the Killing Eve OST.

I updated my server so much that It's actually unrecognisable at this point....

OH AND I FINISHED BOOK ONE OF THE EXOVERSE!!!

Anyway, I can't wait to use this blog again!
I hope the single person who's reading this is as happy as I am.

(Before I go, heres a piece of that Killing Eve ost I was talking about!:  https://open.spotify.com/track/4J4eE4dodiDJWnBW3f9h7q?si=8fe1a97f96a44109 )

Cya!
