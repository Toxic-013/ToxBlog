I think i just turned aromantic lmao, I mean, buff guys still make me hard lol, but the idea of putting my trust in someone again is just scary,
also i prefer being alone.
though i do miss cuddles :(
Spotify is my one true companion.
Also, today was essentially an enormous wakeup call for me.
Had to leave an entire online community behind :(
oh well.
Bye, Manyland!!!
and hello, happy dramaless life!!
