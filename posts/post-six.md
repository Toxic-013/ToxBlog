I have really changed, 
I just gave a really good friend some great advice on how they shouldn't just treat themselves as an average guy.
and they seem to have taken it really well.

I'm so glad i left the game of manyland.com .
I feel like i've entered a new era of myself i guess.

I just hope it lasts.
and i dont destroy it all again, like with so many others.

Well, it's getting late for me, now.

goodnight. readers.
