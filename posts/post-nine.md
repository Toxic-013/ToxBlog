I do not love anyone.
And i finally accept that.

Emotions such as love are just chemical reactions, and when i finally take over the world and become it's robot overlord, i wont have such issues.

But in all seriousness, I'm so glad I figured out I'm aromantic.

Love is just... Pointless

SO FUCK YOU, THE FIVE WIERDO'S THAT LIKE ME!!!!!

The only thing I'm ever sucking is a fucking lollypop.

And the only thing I'm ever kissing is my fucking books when I publish them.

FUCK LOVE

DO HATE INSTEAD.

HATE AND WEED ARE LOVELY!!!

:)

Im serous though, I'm so glad I get it now.

I wasn't just "not finding the right person", because EVERYONE'S just the same: an absolute prick, or just such a cringelord that it's unbearable. I just dont love people.

FULL STOP.

Bye readers, ((which is probably just one person...))
