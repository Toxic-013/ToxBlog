The heat this month is getting unbearable.
Probably doesn't help that I only wear black.
I mean, what am I doing, going to a funeral?

AND, to make matters even worse, the heat is bad for all my **PLANTS** too!
(yes, I am indeed a plant fan.)

Also, some of my classrooms have the radiators on FULL BLAST??????????

In conclusion, heat is bad, plants are cool, and teachers are fucking stupid.

[Also heres some music;](<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/2YBr9RRPy9LiRVs4pqVUXv?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>)
