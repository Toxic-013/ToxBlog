The heat this month is getting unbearable.
Probably doesn't help that I only wear black.
I mean, what am I doing, going to a funeral?

AND, to make matters even worse, the heat is bad for all my **PLANTS** too!
(yes, I am indeed a plant fan.)

Also, some of my classrooms have the radiators on FULL BLAST??????????

In conclusion, heat is bad, plants are cool, and teachers are fucking stupid.
